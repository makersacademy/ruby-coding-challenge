round_up_number
- recalled that there are built in methods to round a float up and down. 
- Searched ruby docs and found #ceil
- called ceil on provided argument

round_down_number
- As above, searched ruby docs and found #floor
- called floor on provided argument

make_numbers_negative
- Tested to confirm if number was positive using if statement
- If positive multiplied by -1
- If not positive returned number
- Refactored later to convert if statement to single line if statement

swap_keys_and_values_in_a_hash
- Typed "ruby swap key value hash" in google, first stackoverflow link suggested hash.invert among other methods. Noted safe_invert if failed.
- Tested hash.invert, worked. Currently don't understand code within safe_invert so have bookmarked for later study
