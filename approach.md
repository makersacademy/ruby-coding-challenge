# Approach to the questions

Look up any unknowns on the ruby-doc.org

Refer to notes from code academy exercises

Using the scientific method seems to be the best general approach to use. Hypothesis -> Prediction -> Test -> Repeat until desired/correct conclusion. This is helping me learn what doesn't work and why, as well as what does.

Remembering that this is as much of a learning excercise as well as one proving knowledge. Google is my friend and it's okay to not know something but knowing how to find the answer and understand it is.

The intial set up of my Ruby environment on my Windows machine outside of the sandbox I've been using was one of the trickier aspects, as well as 'properly' using GitHub. Though occassionally tough, it's taught me new skills for future use (ie Sublime, using the cmd line for testing code and Visual Studio).
