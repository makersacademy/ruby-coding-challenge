My approach was based on few goals.

* Play with ruby for the first time
* Make it work
* Keep it simple
* Submmit in between first 20 people
* Bonus section if I have time.

I used Google Search engine and Ruby docs to get my answers. 

It was a fun exercise that tough me a few things, Ruby is not explicit, and is hard to debug.
