## The Makers Academy Apprenticeship Coding Challenge

### My Approach

### Step 1: Setting Up a Rails Environment 

I came into the challenge completely new to both Git commits and Ruby and really wanted to learn how to establish a local environment, so the first step was researching and installing Ruby, Rails, RVM (+ Gem dependencies) on an Ubuntu machine.

### Step 2: Questions.rb Problem Solving

I looked to make use of [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_\(learning_method\)\#Deliberate_practice) to most effectively benefit from the learning opportunity. I also adopted the *Read, Search and Ask* methodology (popularised by [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) to help work through the challenges: 

1. **Read** the challenge and documentation
2. **Search** Google/Stack Overflow as needed
3. Finally, **Ask** for help (though I didn't need to go beyond Search for this challenge :raised_hands:)

I worked to breakdown each task into simple, component parts which I have outlined in my code. 

Thanks for the opportunity!
