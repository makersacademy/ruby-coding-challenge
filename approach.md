# Details of approach taken to solve the problems

Deconstructed the problems to their smaller components and tackled each one individually to build the final response.

While this is the generl approach, each coding challange had its individual approaches. For example, the challenge of getting elements until you hit one which is larger than 5 had me iterate through the array and stop when an element higher than 5 was found. This was followed by getting the index of that position and creating a substring from the position 0 until that index.

Each challange would require its own explanation, which is going beyond the scope of writing a few words about the approach taken.

Nonetheless, knowing a different programming language helps identify the requiered elements to solve these challanges, even if ruby is a new language for me.
