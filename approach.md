I first looked through all challenges to see which of the problems looked familar.  I then began with the challenges I thought would be easy enought for me to solve.  I then completed challenges that I thought could probably be completed by using existing methods.  I tried to complete all challenges of the same object class before moving on to the next, as I was browsing through and re-reading methods for the relevant class anyway.  I also tried to solve challenges that used a similar approach and/or similar methods first, before looking at the next type of problem.  When in doubt, I wrote out the Code in full, even if that sometimes led to duplication. When I knew the code was working, I went back to refactor.
I left those challenges for last where I knew solutions would be more complex than just chaining methods.  For those, I started off writing the pieces of code I knew would work to achieve a specific sub-result. I then combined the separate pieces of code to form a working script for the final result.

I used the ruby documentation on  http://ruby-doc.com to find approaches to the problems.

Note:  The test for Question 14 was faulty.  I've writte one solution that passes the test, and one solution that actually meets the requirement.
