## I completd the challenges to the best of my ability following the method indicated below in steps.

### Step 1
Read the problem and understanding what I am being asked. Some of the problems were fairly simple and once understood what object I needed to work on I would research the methods of that class, using the Ruby-Doc.org. document.

### Step 2
Some other problems a bit more complex, needed a deeper research of the solution by braking down the problem in smaller
chunks and researching the solution again by using Ruby-Doc.org. document, or stackoverflow.

### Step 3
Once I had a possible solution I was running tests using irb on the terminal. Testing on the terminal helped me to
observe how different methods acted on the same obj.

### Step 4
If the solution I had originally thought of, turned out to be incorrect, I would seek information by reading the error
message, and run a second test on a different hypotheses.
