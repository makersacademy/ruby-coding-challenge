Using irb for command line testing of each test
Checking questions_spec.rb for test requirements

Q5. Summing hash keys and values
Found a similar solution through StackOverflow. Worked but I think it uses a Rails approach which then failed the rspec test. 
Did some more searching and practicing with irb and the inject method. 
Found it was simpler to pull out the keys and values separately, uses the inject method, then sum them separately.
