## ruby-coding-challenge

We're going to practice solving some Ruby problems and be introduced to the `rspec` part of Ruby testing.

These questions vary in level from quite easy to fairly hard.

Work through them and check if they're correct by running `rspec` after trying some code.

You should be able to answer most questions with a couple of lines of code, and just a few methods.

If you're writing a long, complex solution, there's probably a better way.

To run the specs, just run

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~

Good luck

### Rules

* Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
* You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
* The cleaner your code the better!
* Googling is fine as usual

### Tips

* Use the ruby docs http://www.ruby-doc.org/
* Try and break down the problems into smaller chunks. For e.g. if you google "How to select elements in an array that start with a", you won't have much luck. Try and find out a) how to select certain elements in an array, b) how to test if a string starts with an 'a'
* Don't forget Enumerable (advanced array methods)
* Don't panic :wink:
