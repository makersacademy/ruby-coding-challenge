Used to see what the methods were outputting: https://repl.it

I spent a lot of time trying to understand 'git bash', 'github' and command prompt with rails while setting up my working environment.
It felt quite clunky so I decided to find another method. I ended up with 'Atom' text editor which made my code significantly clearer to read through.

I solved questions by breaking them down. Each problem was looked at and solved in theory then syntax was researched and applied expecting a specific outcome using 'print' or 'put' to test on repl.it.
Difficult questions and error messages were looked at again to see if new methods learned for Array, Hashes or Strings could be applied.

Thank you for this opportunity I honestly enjoyed it and hope you can give me feedback on my methods and solutions.
